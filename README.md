# Single-and-Multi-Cycle-CPU

This project is about creating a single-cycle, a multi-cycle and a pipelined cpu using VHDL

The project consists of 5 Phases 
  - Phase 1 through 3 are about the single-cycle cpu
  - Phase 4 is about the Multi-Cycle cpu
  - Phase 5 is about the Pipelined cpu

The Cpu is created based on the instruction set CHARIS

## Phase 1
In this phase hte ALU and the Register File modules are created.

### ALU
The ALU module executes all the logic and arithmetic operations. 



### RegisterFile


## Phase 2
## Phase 3
## Phase 4
## Phase 5
